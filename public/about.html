<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Nadir Mohamed, a passionate problem solver and lifelong learner on a journey through the world of technology. 
  It all started back in high school when I took my first web development class. I went through a lot of ups and downs throughout the quarter
  but worked had and earned a 4.0 in the class. It was something challenging but I enjoyed the satisfaction of completing a project.
  That led me to purse a degree at University of Washington, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
  Those years were filled with occasional all-nighters to complete a project, working with classmates at the computer lab, 
  and the stressful exams that would require hand-written code.

  <p>After graduation, I dove headfirst into the real world of tech, landing a contract gig at Cognixia. 
  There, I honed my craft and sharpened my skills in full stack web development, which was something that wasn't taught in the program.
  The contract ended after sixth months and from there I have been seeking a position in the field ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I currently work as a Program Director working with teenage youth and have led different coding classes from HTML to Java and Python.
  I want to continue to develop as I am open to working any tech position where I can grow and learn on the job. </p>
  
  When I'm not glued to my screen, you can find me playing sports, working on some DIY home projects, 
  or spending time with my family. 
  
  So, if you're in the market for a dedicated, adaptable, and all-around awesome developer, look no further! 
  Let's chat and see how we can create some digital magic together.</p>
